/*The form displays input properly only if the add button is clicked.
 Clean project before running so that the output does not keep compounding itself.*/

This program gets input of resume information from a web form, checks that the fields are not blank, and adds them to an array list.
It then puts the inputs in a database called WeekFourChallenge that has all the information.  
It also sends the contents of the array lists to an output web page.
